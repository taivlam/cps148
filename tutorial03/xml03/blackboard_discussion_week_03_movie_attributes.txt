# Blackboard Disussion Post - Week 3

## Question

> What attributes might you create for a "movie" XML element? What default, if any, would you use for the attributes? Which values, if any, might be fixed?

## Response

I would have the following items as required attributes:
* title
* year (input of something like `unknown` could be allowed)
* director (input such as `unknown` could be allowed)

The following items could have a default value of being empty:
* time/length of duration
* cast
* distributor
* head of cinematography
* lead composer
* budget
* box office earnings
* score(s) from aggregate rating sites (such as IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic)
* trailer video
* movie poster
