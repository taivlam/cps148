In `pacman`, the `docbook-xml` and `docbook-xsl` packages provide the command `xmllint` in the terminal emulator for Arch Linux based distros (if both packages aren't already installed).

To validate a Schema document, use the following command:
```
xmllint --schema yourxsd.xsd yourxml.xml --noout
```
