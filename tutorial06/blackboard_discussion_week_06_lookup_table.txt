## Answer

* Title: Lookup Table for XSLT

An example of a real world scenario where a lookup table would be a valuable resource for an XSLT application is a course catalog search box or search engine for a college/university.  For example, as one way of using the search box, a student could search for courses to take for next semester by first searching in the Chemistry major/department as an example, and an XSLT application would use a lookup table to find all courses filed under "Chemistry" for next semester, fall 2021.
