            Take the Battle to the Hardwood
            
                Net Force 12 is the latest release in the Net Force series of basketball 
                simulation games. Using motion capture technology designed specifically for 
                Net Force, this release captures the signature moves of the top players in 
                the NBA, . No other basketball simulation has this lineup of stars. Additional 
                features include support for motion-sensor game controllers, dynamic shot 
                generation, touch-sensitive passing, and "flash-to-the-hoop" acceleration 
                for uncontested slam dunks.
