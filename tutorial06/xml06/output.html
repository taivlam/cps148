                I've owned all of the Dance Off releases from the beginning. It's my favorite workout
                video every morning. I have lost 12 pounds with very little modification of my diet.
            </p>
<p>
                Dance Off just gets better with every release. The song tracks are great. There is a wonderful
                selection of new and old tracks from around the world; some obscure and others more popular, 
                including several that are in heavy rotation on the radio right now. Most tracks have several
                choreographic alternatives that can be unlocked by earning in-game dance points.
            </p>

<p>
                A so-so release of this well-established title. The user interface is improved and easier to use and
                game provides a few great songs, a few terrible ones, and several mediocre ones. The graphics are 
                beautiful and the sets are stunning and fun (without being distracting.)
            </p>
<p>
                Where this release fails is in the choreography. The dances just aren't as much fun as the previous 
                titles. Many of the moves follow predictable patterns; they're stale and that's a big problem for a 
                dance game. I hope the next release improves the choreography because it's great in all other
                phases of the game.

                I bought this for my 13 year old daughter and her friends. They had exhausted the songs from the
                earlier releases and looking for a new challenge. This release includes the most current songs with
                GREAT new moves. My daughter also likes the new format and is getting hours of fun (and exercise!) 
                out of the game.

                If you've played any of the previous Dance Off release then you know what to expect from this fun
                game. New users: give it a try.  It's kind of goofy and a lot of fun and unlike other games, it's a
                great source of exercise for "couch potatoes. It's not just for kids; sneak in some exercise when your
                children are away.
            </p>
<p>
                This new release works the same way as the previous entries in this series: select a song and follow the 
                animated dancers on the monitor; closely mimic their moves and gain points, fall off the routine and lose
                points. The songs focus on the current pop stars, but there are a few classic pop and rock standards from 
                the 70's, 60's, and 50's.
            </p>
<p>
                Be sure to explore the World Dance mode where you can play with friends online.

                The installation was buggy and kept crashing my gaming console. I spent several hours on tech support
                with no solution to my problem. I finally returned it and got my money back. I wish I could give it a
                zero star rating. FIX IT ANASTA!!!!

                I popped this into my gaming console and was up and dancing in just a few minutes. I did have a few minor
                problems downloading some of the new music tracks but the company sent me a patch and the issue was
                quickly resolved.
            </p>
<p>
                <i>Dance Off</i> provides a great variety of songs spanning different genres and a lot of good upbeat pop music. 
                The group dances are fun too where you and your friends can enjoy goofy and fun choreography. The backgrounds and 
                costumes have gotten quite elaborate in this new release. I especially enjoyed the Disney-themed stage with characters
                from several of the Princess movies.
            </p>
<p>
                A nice bonus is you can also hook up a usb microphone to get karaoke points. This release has it all!!!

                I've enjoyed this game from Version 1.0 and this release did not let me down. World Dance is a great new feature that 
                lets you feel connected to dancers across the world. The have a good mix of old and new songs. The ability to setup a 
                custom playlist is another feature I love about this game.

<p>
                It's a nice game with some clever graphics; but I found this release with several sound tracks of questionable taste and
                content to be poorly suited to my younger nieces. The rating should not have been 10+ years of age. It should be older. 
                They should have provided an age-filter for those of us who care about what our kids are listening to.

                I've been buying Dance Off since it first came out and I'm really happy with this upgrade. The choreography is difficult 
                but keep dancing! You'll quickly get the hang of it and then the fun really starts. I sometimes use this game 
                in place of my morning exercise class. You won't work up a sweat at first because you'll be learning the steps. Once
                you have the routines mastered, you'll be burning off more calories than in the toughest aerobic workouts.
            </p>
<p>
                The variety is GREAT! It doesn't include only American pop hits. I love the Latin music stage. I also like the fact
                that once you learn the dance for the song, you can download other dances for the same song.
            </p>
<p>
                I don't like that I'm the only one playing this game at my home, so the World Dance feature is a great bonus. I don't really
                care about the points system and getting on the "leader board." That's not why I play this game; but if that's your 
                motivation, then go for it.

                This is my first experience with Dance Off. I've danced all of my life, so playing a video game version of dancing 
                has not interested me. I decided however to give it a try after hearing from my friends how great this game was.
            </p>
<p>
                The choreography is difficult, but an average dancer will pick it up. I was able follow the steps and get some of the
                routines mastered. Sometimes however the game doesn't count my moves properly. I had to exaggerate my moves in order
                to get recognized. I'm petite but that shouldn't make difference.
            </p>
<p>
                I'll keep this game because I like the exercise aspect of it; but the point system doesn't really work. My advice
                is to ignore the point counter because it really doesn't work well and you can have enough fun doing the routines.

                The new release of <i>Dance Off</i> is finally here. There are many new and exciting features and the soundtrack shows a
                great variety of tunes and styles. I was pleasantly surprised by the 80's music stage.
            </p>
<p>
                There are some flaws with this release. They switched the  format (why???) and you relearn all of your old 
                moves. Still, it's beautiful and worth the money I like earning points while dancing and I like cashing in 
                those points to reveal hidden features and stages. The calorie burning data is awesome. That feature is
                great for those of you who use this game for exercise.
            </p>
<p>
                Look for me on the Leader Board, burning up the stage. Ha!

                This is the fifth <i>Dance Off</i> title that I own. The user interface is the best so far and is easy to use. 
                The music selection is on par with other dance games: a few great songs but some which are best described
                as "filler." Some games are not improved by adding "more" and this is one of them. I like the graphics and
                the variety of stages.
            </p>
<p>
                Still, this only gets 3 stars from me because of the choreography. The dances just aren't as much fun as 
                they were in previous releases. I think the moves are predictable and repetitive. More variation would have
                been better. It's a shame because the developers did so much right in other areas of the game.

                It's a dance game and one of the best games on the market; however, I found that after a week I had
                pretty much mastered all of the routines. I'll probably load this one from time to time but not 
                more than that.
            </p>

                If you like dance games, then this is a good one to get.

                I just picked this one up and I think it's fantastic!!! Fun songs, great moves! Hours, literally hours
                of fun with your friends.
            </p>
<p>
                What really puts this release over the top is the <b>World Dance stage</b>. I love playing against other dancers
                across the globe and I've made some new friends that way. It doesn't hurt to see my name on the leader
                boards either. This feature helped me break out of rut and try new songs and moves.
            </p>
<p>
                My only complaint is that there are a few songs in which the movement skips. I don't know whether to blame our
                gaming console or the game itself. I did not notice this problem on earlier releases. Perhaps I need to upgrade
                my system because the motion control features do require a lot of processing power.

                I'm not a big dance game fan (first person shooters are more my interest.) So if you like this kind of game,
                you'll probably like this release a lot. I think the different dance stages add variety and interest
                to the game. The music is okay for the most part (the type of music I like wouldn't really work for
                a dance game.)

                Another nice release in a venerable and classic title. The graphics are greatly improved for this release and
                the updated playlist is nice. I like the World Dance stage though I probably won't use it too much. I'm more
                of a soloist myself. I like to dance but I don't like to compete.
            </p>
<p>
                The software could be a bit more responsive however. I found myself making moves that did not register on the
                screen. And then I began overcompensating for this glitch and that made me feel that I was doing less dancing
                and more stomping. The movement should be seamless and it's not. However it's still better than any other
                dance game out there.

                feature of this game. It allows me to reconnect with my friends back home, who I greatly miss! Now,
