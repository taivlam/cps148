# Blackboard Discussion Assignment - Week 4

## Question

> Think of a scenario in which a company would need to create compound documents from at least two vocabularies. What elements could have the same name and would cause a name collision without namespacing?

## Answer: Namespacing to Prevent Name Collisions in Compound Documents

Taking the example from Tutorial 4 on page 226 in the book, a company that is creating a compound document from RSS and iTunes would require namespacing to prevent name collisions.  For example, the `<category>` and `<image>` elements would require namespacing to prevent ambiguous name collisions between RSS and iTunes.
